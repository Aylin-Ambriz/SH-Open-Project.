Get out!” “Witch! Witch!” “You’re disgusting!” “Don’t follow us!”)\n\nBut still...ah...mother...I was happy...\nDid...you know...why? Because you were with me\n\nSo why did my mother abandon me?\nI wanted to know that no matter what...\n\nA monastery in a big city took me in when I was young\nBut because of the violent storms of Reformation\nAnd the new believers, ah, it was destroyed mercilessly\n(“We’re gonna drive out the fallen clergy!”\n“Destroy their altar! True faith is in our hands!”\n“Stop it! Please stop it!”)\n\nLife has its ups and downs, and since I cannot grasp the workings of fate\nI believed that one end leads to another beginning; working up my courage\nI began my trip in search for my homeland, to seek the answer for my longstanding question\n\nCrossing the river, going left at the ghostly fir\nAnd there stood the place of my birth\n\n“What awaited me was a stone-like old woman,\n(“I’m home, mother...eh!?” “Oh, you’re the one sent by our Lord Jesus. Thank you for coming.”)\nI could hardly believe that this stranger could be my mother.\n(“It’s stale bread, but did it match your tastes?” “I can eat this forever!”)\nI saw no light of recognition in her eyes, and looking at her, desperate for food,\n(“Madam, do you not know who I am?” “What are you babbling about...”)\nI thought that she’d already lost her mind.\n(“Are you discriminating against me too? Give me more, give me more food!”)\nAnd...\n(“Noooooo!”)\n\nI converted, but it was too late\nIt became impossible to secure food for even one person.\nAn inverted cross that makes a mockery of repentance.\nMy prayers don’t reach.\nWithout gaining forgiveness, sins merely increase in number...\n\n\n“I see...\nSo that’s how you were sacrificed? Against your will, to boot...\nThis might take some time, but a child’s grudge should be avenged by a child.\nIs that alright?\nNow, let the revenge tragedy begin.”\n\n\nPoor siblings[children] who were abandoned in the forest\nI understand the sad feelings of abandoned children, painfully so\n\nAh, controlling the birds, I made the trail of breadcrumbs disappear\n(“The breadcrumbs are...getting eaten!”)\nI had the birds, white as snow, sing in invitation\n(“Ah! Hey, brother, that’s an interesting bird!”\n“You’re right. Let’s try chasing it!”)\n\n“Look, Hänsel, big brother. There’s a house over there!”\n“But Gretel, that might be a scary witch’s house...still.”\n“Still?”\n“Better than...dying with an empty stomach!”\n\n“Is anyone here?”\n“Oh my, what cute guests. Are you hungry? Come on in.”\n\n“The roof is made out of lebkuchen, the windows are of sugar.\nI’ll give you this delicious house made from sweets!”\n\nAh, you don’t need to hold back\nLetting kids eat as much as they wanted has always been my small dream\nAh, my loan shark husband didn’t come back alive\nBut he left me with some inheritance...\n\nThe siblings[two] took advantage of the old woman’s kindness; her selfless actions, and ate\n(“This is delicious! Gretel, you have some too!” “Yeah, it’s delicious, brother!”)\nOne day, the girl looked at the boy who’d become round and grew afraid\n(“Delicious!” “B-brother?” “Delicious! Gretel, if you’re not going to eat, let me have your portion!”)\n\n“Ah! The old woman is a witch, and she’s going to eat us!”\n\nIt’d be B-A-D if we don’t kill her before she kills us!\nKick her HARD! In the back!\n\n“You won’t be able to eat us.”\n“You’re great, Gretel! Now the witch’s finished!”\n“We have to let Thomas know as well.”\n“Yep, the evil witch was burnt, and now all treasure”\n“Belongs to us!”\n\n“Hey Tom-“\n“Tom-“\n“Hey there Hans! How did you get so fat?”\n“Tada!”\n“Woah! We really got lucky!”\n\n\n“So every old woman who lives in the forest alone are witches.”\n“Geez, children are such cold-hearted liars. I hate them.

You scum!”\nShe says-\n\nBut I’m working hard today as well, daddy[Vati]!\n\nThe sun sets, ah, and I’m covered with dust. Cooking, washing, all of that was pushed onto me\nAh, my ill-natured sister’s favorite phrase\n\n“Do you want me to tell on you? You scum!”\nShe says-\n\nBut I’ll work hard tomorrow as well, daddy!\n\nMy dad was a boat rider, but somehow he fell into a well and died.\nSo I don’t really like wells.\nStill, my stepmother was merciless to me...\n\nI spun thread beside the well, and my fingertips are...\nScratched, and red blood flows out\nStaining the spindle red,\nSo when I looked into the well, hoping to wash it\nIt flew out of my hand like a fish yearning for water\nAnd sunk into the depths of well.\n\nLike a maiden[Loreley] who laments her sad love-\n\n(“I’m home~~”)\nI went home crying, but my stepmother said to me mercilessly-\n“You scum! Get it back even if you have to dive in! If not, no dinner for you tonight!”\n“You scum!” “Get it back!” “No dinner for you tonight!”\n\nI hurried on, with dusk pressing at my back...\n\n“What should I do, daddy? Worst case scenario, I’ll be going over! Ceui!”\n\n3\n2\n1\n\n\n“I see, you’re a pretty miserable but energetic child.\nIf you’re unsure about your revenge, I’ll give you some time.\nStay in this border’s ancient well for a while,\nAnd think over your grudge...”\n\n\nWhen I woke up, I saw beautiful grassy plains\nThousands of flowers bloomed\nWithin a well leading towards another land, I met a man[Id] embracing his impulse[Id]\nAnd sang of my grudge under his conducting. Am-\nI dead? Is this heaven? Or my imagination? I don’t know.\nBut it’s alright! I’ll do my best, daddy, like always!\n\n“We’re in a fix. Pull me out, pull me out.\nI’m already nicely toasted.”\n“Seriously!?”\n“We have a problem here. Shake me down, shake me down.\nEveryone’s already ripe.”\n“Ohh!”\n\nListening to the request of the speaking bread\nI took them all out with a shovel\n“Yay~☆”\n\nAnd-\nI shook the apple tree until all of them came tumbling down\n\nAfter that-\nIt’s a simple matter of piling up the scattered apples\n“Fuu~☆”\n\n“Bass!”\n“Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bee-doo♪”\n\n“Guitar!”\n\n“Piano!”\n\n“Thank you!”\n\n“You’re quite an energetic child...”\n“Kyah-!”\n“Ahahahaha! No need to fear.”\n“Ah, don’t tell me, you’re that Madam Holle mentioned in the fairytales!?”\n“Geez, what a bad mouth. Don’t call me madam, call me big sis.”\n\n“All things with form will crumble someday,\nAll living things will welcome death someday.\nYou’ve worked hard until now. You’re a strong girl.\nBut if you work for me from now on, you’ll definitely become happy!”\n\n“Okay, I’ll work hard!”\n\nAh, shaking up the beautifully whirling feather blankets is my new job\nAh, making flowers of snow fall on the ground is my small deed\n\n“If you want to meet winter, just tell me ♥”\n\n“Ouch!”\n“Now, now! Don’t get it over your head!\nBut still, you’ve worked very hard for me up till now.\nI’ll grant your wish of homecoming. Holle!”\n\nWhen the big doors opened, it rained gold\nIn a split second, I was covered with it from head to toe...\n\n\n“That’s a reward for all the work you’ve done.\nWell, don’t hesitate to take it.\nHowever, if your attitude towards work wasn’t serious enough,\nMaybe something else would’ve rained down...”\n\n\nCock-a-doodle-doo! Our golden lady is home!\n“I’m home!”\n\nThe day passes, ah, I’m covered with gold. I don’t have to do all the cooking or washing anymore!\nAh, words of wisdom from my fool of a stepmother\n\n“Why don’t you get some as well, 《My Dear Daughter》[Chi-chan]”\n“Okay, I’ll work hard...”\nShe says-\n\nIf you can do it, then go ahead and try!\n\n“Now, let the revenge tragedy begin!”\nCock-a-doodle-doo! Our pitchy lady is home!\n\nThe day ends, ah, you’re covered in pitch\nSee, your lazy attitude is your sin, you reap what you sow! Hey-\n\nWhy don’t you work hard from now on!\n\n“No! I can’t get this off! It’s not coming off! No no no! Take it off, take it off mutti!”\n“Ah, poor you...”\n“No no! No no no!”\n“My, my, isn’t that nice. It fits you, Chi! Ahahahaha!”\n“No no! no no no!”\n“Why is this happening to a good kid like you!?”\n“Nooooo!”\n“Ahahahaha....”\n\n\n“This time’s revenge was pretty cute.”\n“Oh my, being covered in pitch all of your life is a punishment worse than death for a girl! Ahahahaha!”"

My name is Yamaguchi.\nThis is your first time being interviewed by this magazine, I look forward to this interview.\nHere's a simple question to start us out; Could you please tell us how you first got into music, Noël-san?\n\n...from “S♪UND AR♪UND”\n\nI remember… only faintly… that the first instrument I touched was…\na piano… but as for lessons…\n\nthose didn't last long…\nsince I just wasn't the type of kid…\nwho could sit still in front of a piano…\n\nI see. So for that brief period your musical world was closed off.  \nHowever, if the story ended there you wouldn't be here today, right?\n\n...“S♪UND AR♪UND”...\n\nFrom even my earliest memories… music's always been around me…\nIt was never really something… I had to study intensely…\n\nMy family was poor, but my grandmother…\ndesperately begged her relatives for money…\nand managed to get me a broken-down organ…\n\n\nI see. I apologize if this sounds rude, but that is a surprisingly touching story.\nOne grandmother's love lit up the path of music to a young Noël.\nBut such a touching childhood memory, that doesn't seem becoming of your current musi-\nEr, my apologies. I shouldn't be biased. Do you mind if we talk a bit more about it?\n\n...“S♪UND AR♪UND”...\n\n\nInterview with Noël...\n\n──Yep, that's definitely true. When it comes to VaniStar's music, it has the sound of someone screaming from the very pit of their soul that spits up blood, with a totally brutal guitar sound to accelerate that scream.\nHey, how’d you and guitars first meet, Noëy?\n\n...from “HEAVY⚡EDGE”\n\n\n                                                                                   Middle School\nBy the time I reached 《A Shithole for Brats Who've Only Matured Physically》\n                                                                                         Kindness\nI completely lost any belief I had left in 《Self-Righteous Nepotism》\n\n                                                Old Hag\nThe 《One Who Only Raised Me Outta Convenience》 made a deal;\n                                                                                   My Soul\nIn exchange for 《Indoctrination into Whatever Adults Wanted Me to Believe》, a cheap electric guitar\n\nWith this I could destroy this worthless world\n                                                                                                                Rock\nas long as I had a wolf's heart, a single guitar, and 《The Real Soul of Music》\nI howled ‘n anyone ‘round me became my enemy\nIf you touch me I'll bare my fangs ‘cause it'd hurt if someone licked my wounds……\n\n\nI had that same edgy phase as a brat. Isn't it just some kinda ‘Middle-School Syndrome’ thing? Amazing.\nTho, even at my peak I probably wasn't as self conscious as you (Laughs).\n…Btw, Noël, do you still think rock can destroy the world?\n\n...“HEAVY⚡EDGE”...\n\n\nInterview with Noël...\nGood day. It’s an honor and privilege to meet you.\nFrom the aesthetic monthly magazine “✝V-ROCK🌹HEAVEN✝,\" I’m marie*marie.\nThe band “VANISHING STARLIGHT” has caught my eye recently. May I ask, dear Noël-sama, your experiences with bands?\n...from “✝V-ROCK🌹HEAVEN✝\"\n\nThe first band I joined was this cringey metal band\n                                              Technique\nWe had no 《Skills to Perform Even to Ourselves》, we just wanted to look cool, We'd go off looking for someone to pick fights with just to get pissed off\n\nI was stunned when I saw just how different our musical style was,\nIt was all pointless, I just spun out my wheels over ‘n over……\n\n──and in the end… there was no one in my band…\n Destined\n《Fated》 to fade out… A burnt out… VANISHING STAR… Its shine was for but a moment…\n\nMy, so that is your unknown story.\nThe scars of youth. Such a sorrowful glimmer.\nSo, is that why you decided to focus more on solo work after that?\n\n...“✝V-ROCK HEAVEN✝\"...\n\n\nInterview with Noël...\n──I see. That's interesting.\nBy the way, “Noel” is such an interesting name.\nI have such an ordinary name, so I must admit I admire your name.\nMine is so simple, it's “Hajime'' written with the kanji “Ichi” and “Yamaguchi”, only seven strokes (Laughs).\n\n...from “S♪UND AR♪UND”\n\n\nNah… It's not that great… it may sound cool but…\nThey all called me “Chris Masuo (Laughs)”\n\n──Ah…\nI'd hunt down those… pieces of shit who'd laugh at me…\n'n wouldn't let ‘em apologize… I just beat ‘em ‘till I saw blood…\n\nA (tentative) arrival date? A simple name?\n\nThe bastard who thought that up… was my piece of shit dad…\nBut… he kicked the bucket way before I was born… so I never got to beat ‘m up for it……\n\n\n……\nI apologize. It was thoughtless of me to bring such a thing up.\nI dearly apologize if I offended you. Truly.\nSo, you were raised by a single mother, Noël-san?\n……Er, my apologies, I may have misremembered,\nbut earlier, didn't you mention being raised by your grandmother……?\n\n...“S♪UND AR♪UND”...\n\n\n──No… don't apologize, it's fine…\nI know… you didn't… mean to offend or anything…\nBut… it's just that such a thing… is complicated…\nSo if you want an easy-to-understand summary… I'll do my best──\n\n\n                             fall in love              believe it must be destiny\nThe two lovers                          and\n                      elope ‘n run off            they're disowned, no foreigners!\n\nThe hole-digging French migrant worker          in a hole           dies without a cent\n                                                                          falls                    and\n             The beautiful Japanese maiden             with child        can't pay rent\n\n           The widow leaves her child                    disappears, now\n                                                               and                                             all alone\nThe old lady uses all her strength             takes care of the child\n\n \n   The kid's passed                     to relatives,                         say “what a tragedy”!\n                                     around                                they all\n              They walk                   like saints, but                      beat him, no restraint!\n\n──Sorry for making a joke of it, Yama-san.\nBut it's a hard thing to talk about sober!\n\nActually… this plastic bottle… ain't filled with water, but vodka (Laughs)\n\n\n……\nVodka!?

      "content": "~\n2014 Interview/Review with Nikkei Entertainment! about Revo's Success Translation\nPublished in Nov. 2014 Issue of Nikkei Entertainment!\nPublication date: 2014.10.04\nWritten by Koutarou Asou \n\nNikkei Entertainment! Page 79\nNikkei Entertainment! Page 79\nFrom His Original Music Dramas to the Theme Song of 'Attack on Titan,' the True Face of the Talented Artist Celebrating the 10th Anniversary of His Debut: Sound Creator Revo\nReview: \nThe theme song \"Guren no Honoo\"(sic.) embodies the worldview of the series:\n\nA song he made for 'Attack on Titan' catapulted him into fame, leading to his debut appearance at NHK Kouhaku Uta Gassen. Revo, the fashionable figure known for his signature sunglasses, is the lyricist, composer, and singer for the individual unit Linked Horizon (LinHora). He is an artist with a strong presence, something that has not been seen in the star-studded music industry for quite some time.\n\nI have been watching 'Attack on Titan' since the first episode, and I personally feel that \"Guren no Yumiya,\" the theme song, perfectly embodies the worldview of the series. Unlike typical anime song composers, Revo's melodies don't follow formulaic melody patterns. Rather, his sound blends rock and classical music together, reminiscent of Queen. The lyrics often feature more literary language rather than everyday speech, showcasing a poetic and literary inclination similar to Ringo Sheena's works and the heavy use of Chinese-derived terms in Vocaloid songs. However, compared to those examples, the overall balance of Revo's songs is well thought out, and it doesn't devolve into mere word play. When one has a rich vocabulary, the world of poetry naturally becomes more polished as their music grows, as is the case with Ringo Sheena. In that sense, Revo's lyrics have the potential to evolve even more from this point. He may be able to create a new style of deep lyrical world that can be heard and understood by listening. \n\nRevo has garnered quite the attention in the industry, as evidenced by his effortless composing of the theme song to the anime 'Sailor Moon Crystal,' performed by Momoiro Clover Z. Responsible for the lyrics, music, and arrangement, Revo managed to bring out the essence of the anime while also highlighting the strengths of MomoClo. \n\nAlthough his own activities are his main focus, if he dedicated himself to making songs for others, he has the potential to leave his mark on the history of JPOP forever. \n\n\nInterview: \nClassical, Prog. Rock, and Dostoevsky are His Origins\n\nThe female editor who accompanied me was very excited about meeting \"THE Revo-sama in person!\" At his live performance at Saitama Arena, cheers erupted when he appeared on stage, with fans screaming \"Heika!\" Apparently they call him that. However the person I met was extremely affable and kind-hearted.\n\n— What are your musical roots?\n\n\"Rock and classical music, mainly. Then I encountered progressive rock.\"\n\nReflecting on his past musical influences, he mentioned \"Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, and Jimi Hendrix; their powerful guitar riffs pierced my teenage heart.\" Regarding progressive rock, he noted, \"I was drawn to the complex, irregular time signatures of ELP, King Crimson, and other prog. rock bands.\"\n\nThough his rock influences often overshadow it, Revo's appreciation for classical music (as a fundamental influence in his early life) undoubtedly enriches his artistic vision. Lyrics like \"Carrying death to twilight with/the bow and arrows of Hades...\" highlight his literary inspirations. \"I was fond of Dostoevsky,\" he remarked, which was quite striking. \n\nOriginally, Revo released long, musical theater-like compositions on CD. Their popularity led to stage adaptations, attracting a substantial female fanbase. Revo's unique, fantastical and surrealistic stories and his music spread by word-of-mouth, and his live performances became popular musical-like shows. He named the group of performers on stage \"Sound Horizon\" (SanHora), which he leads. Initially a solo project he later used the name \"Linked Horizon\" (LinHora) for game music and anime theme song offers to distinguish it from SanHora. \n\n\"This fall, which marks SanHora's 10th anniversary, I'll be debuting a six-member rock band called 'Vanishing Starlight,' produced by me, Revo.\" The music and lyrics of the band maintain Revo's signature allure. \n\n\"I believe the success of \"Guren no Yumiya\" was largely due to its viral spread on video sharing sites. Fan creations and the like just further fueled the flames. It was just good timing\" He calmly analyzed, showing his grounded and realistic nature. \"I composed a new song for the theatrical release of 'Attack on Titan' as well. I believe people will think 'This is a great song too.'\"",

      "content": "~\n\nLinked Horizon Interview with natalie about 'Shingeki no Kioku' Translation\n\n\n\nArticle publication date: 2024.08.30\nLink: https://natalie.mu/music/pp/linkedhorizon04 \n\n\n\nLinked Horizon's best album “Memories of 'Attack on Titan' (Shingeki no Kioku)” has been released.\nLinked Horizon provided many songs for the TV anime series 'Attack on Titan' that aired for 10 years from 2013 to 2023, and 'Shingeki no Kioku' contains many of Linked Horizon's songs for 'Attack on Titan' that trace its history.\n\nMusic Natalie interviewed Revo of Linked Horizon, who has spent more than 10 years with 'Attack on Titan.' He talked about a new overall picture that emerged when he went to combine songs separately released into a single work. \n\nInterview and text by Akihiro Tomita\n\n\nOriented Towards both Music and Storytelling\n──When I first saw the promo materials for 'Shingeki no Kioku,' I saw that it mentioned that it was \"The final collaboration between 'Attack on Titan' and Linked Horizon.\" This made it really sink in for me that the end was really near. How do you feel about it, Revo-san?\n\nRevo: When it comes to the songs, \"Nisennen... Moshiku wa... Nimannengo no Kimi e...\" (The theme song for TV Anime 'Attack on Titan' The Final Chapters [Movie Version]), was the last song I wrote for the series so, in that sense, it had already ended when I composed that. In terms of albums, there hadn't been a release since 'Shingeki no Kiseki' (2017). With the story finally ending, I did feel like it would be nice to release a best album at the end... but my emotions are a little mixed. Sure, it's sad that it's over, but anything that starts eventually ends. If I can mark the end of the series with \"a testament to my journey alongside the world of 'Attack on Titan,'\" then I can go on to the next thing... or something like that. Of course, this doesn't mean 'Attack on Titan' has ended in the minds of everyone, and I hope that fans can enjoy it for the rest of their lives, returning to it over and over. But, as a creator, I have to move on to the next thing. No matter how wonderful the worldview is, I can't just settle there forever. I have to aim and conquer the next wilderness. Well, maybe I'm making myself sound too cool (laughs). I also have to do my best with my main job, Sound Horizon. \n\n──Did you originally plan to release a best album after the anime concluded?\n\nRevo: No, I just faced each project as it came to me. We could say that I only ended up making so many songs for 'Attack on Titan' because of that, not because I had a plan or anything. An album like 'Shingeki no Kiseki' is quite uncommon in the theme song scene. Usually, a theme song is just a one-off thing. I didn't know how long the series would continue for or how much I'd be involved going forward. That's why it was such a stroke of luck for me to be able to create \"inspired image songs\" for the series, and also being able to turn them into an album with 'Shingeki no Kiseki.' When I was making \"Guren no Yumiya\" (the opening theme for Season 1), I didn't have any concept of creating something like 'Shingeki no Kiseki.' \n\n──Your biggest concert tour ever was also linked to 'Attack on Titan.'\n\nRevo: Looking back, I think the fact that I've always orientated myself towards music and storytelling aligned well with elements of 'Attack on Titan.' Strictly speaking, the sound of Sound Horizon and Linked Horizon are different, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna suddenly turn Linked Horizon into a J-POP band (laughs). Being able to create concerts that incorporate my musical methodology and storytelling style from Sound Horizon was a really significant experience for me. Linked Horizon's music may be somewhat easier to listen to, but that doesn't mean the core and essence of my music was going to change. \n\n\n──Listening to 'Shingeki no Kioku,' I felt that I was listening to a single piece of \"Story Music.\" The method you've pursued for over 20 years—of telling and playing out a story within one album—is alive in this album as well. It almost feels like an original album of yours. \n\nRevo: In terms of the purpose theme songs are meant to serve and the fact that each track was created at different times, it may be a bit of a weaker form of the \"Story Music\" I've originally aimed for. However, the historical aspect of these songs depicting the world of 'Attack on Titan' help to elevate this album to the level of Story Music. There are, of course, parts of the story that are naturally distant from each other. For example, especially around the \"Marley Arc\" there's a sudden gap, where I was hardly involved. \n\n──Linked Horizon returned to the series with \"Saigo no Kyojin\" as the opening theme to the episodic release of 'Attack on Titan' The Final Chapters, and concluded Linked Horizon's story with the series with \"Nisennen... Moshiku wa... Nimannengo no Kimi e...\"\n\nRevo: Without those two songs, there couldn't have been a 'Shingeki no Kioku.' Even if I had been asked to release a best album without those two songs, I would have declined. \n\nBetween Remixing and Remastering\n──The structure of the album is quite intense, starting off strong with the story-driven music of \"Guren no Yumiya,\" then seamlessly progressing through tracks like \"Kakumei no Yoru ni,\" \"Akatsuki no Requiem,\" and \"Shoukei to Shikabane no Michi,\" all the way to the climax of the album. Even though it's a best album, it gets really heated as the album plays. \n\nRevo: Yes, it is pretty intense and dense (laughs). This album is just shy of being a complete discography, a few tracks were left out when I compiled the music, but I think it still feels pretty substantial and impactful. For listeners, it might feel that it's packed with \"So much LinHora\" that it's overwhelming. Even I got tired while I was making it (laughs). \n\n──That kind of \"pressure\" is quite fitting for 'Attack on Titan' (laughs). The theme songs create highlights, while the other songs focus on memorable scenes, creating highs and lows that make it surprisingly easy to listen to. I heard that you remastered all of the tracks for this best album. How did it feel to revisit your past songs?\n\nRevo: It made me once again realize that \"nothing's really changed.\" For Sound Horizon's 15th Anniversary Project, I re-released each CD as a remastered edition, and I was surprised by how much I had changed since back then. Of course, they're all different works, so it's natural to find differences, but this time, when I lined up all the songs I made for 'Shingeki no Kioku,' even though some songs were over ten years apart, there was hardly any disconnect when listening to the album as a whole. There was a consistent worldview expressed. However, because the sound quality and direction varied throughout the songs, I paid very close attention to balancing those aspects during the remastering. The balance between music and sound effects differs greatly from song to song. I also made significant adjustments to how much one could hear the vocals against hearing the accompaniment. The work we did went far beyond what's typically considered a \"remastering.\" \n\nIf we consider music where there is a conscious choice over what sounds listeners can and can't hear out of the raw chaos is the supreme richness, then heavily rearranged music with a bias is probably going to be seen as \"being made listenable.\" the truth is, the things hidden behind the pleasant sounds are lost if I present the completely raw, unmastered chaos, and I'm aware of the fact that my style is to put too many sounds in the first place. I've concluded that this approach is the best way to reach a broader audience. I know this may not be the best way to phrase it, but whether you spoil the listeners or not, whether you trust them and respect their freedom or distrust them and want to control them, and whether you treat the work as a piece of art or a product, all of these are gradients, not binary choices. So, the creator who reigns as king over their work, end up hesitating and is perplexed. Such questions are not only challenging for me, but also funny because they resonate strongly with 'Attack on Titan' (laughs). To put it simply, it's like I've re-painted and balanced the underlying philosophies of each song from a fresh perspective. \n\n\n──You really made sure the album was consistent throughout. \n\nRevo: In other words, it's somewhere between remixing and remastering. There are enough changed where if you listen and compare it to the previously released versions, you'll find that what you hear and what you feel from your ears are quite different. If it were a traditional best album, I wouldn't have gone that far. The best works are those that utilize the various memories people have formed from the past to the present, so it's natural that the songs would sound differently, and I think there should be an aspect that enjoys that difference. However, what I wanted to evoke in this album was not the history of my music, but rather evoke a history of the memories of my music with 'Attack on Titan.' So if the differences between these songs released far apart from each other were not \"different\" in a positive sense, but instead just noise that'd distract from the immersion in the worldview of the best album, I made sure to steer clear of including such elements in this remastered work. Perhaps I was massively overthinking this, bit I decided to do what I could to assure the listener's immersion. I think this is naturally how the album came to be when I aimed for a form that would allow the audience to listen to the album with a sense of unity all the way through. I focused on the listening experience heavily. The fact that I can go from the beginning to the end without changing the worldview or musicality means that I was able to face 'Attack on Titan' with a firm resolution for over ten years. \n\nThe Arrow that Kept Flying 'till the End\n──The consistent musical style you set for 'Attack on Titan' from the beginning, like having prog-rock and heavy metal elements, as well as the arrangement of the band and orchestra combo, is proof that your musical approach never waved, right?\n\nRevo: Actually, when I was first writing \"Guren no Yumiya,\" I hesitated about how I should incorporate orchestral composition. There was a lot of trial and error back then. I was in the process of trying to refine how to blend the best aspects of a band sound with the best aspects of an orchestral sound, and present them as a single ensemble. In this remastering process I revisited that fusion. While the instruments and arrangements that make up the music haven't changed, it's still possible to alter the nuances of the music's flavor. Balancing the solid foundational role the rhythm plays with the scale of the sound and what's called the dimensionality of the sound's depth can be tricky, as they often overlap each other, especially in the lower frequencies. I wanted to make different instruments with different resonances complement each other, without it sounding too disjointed. It's like trying to emulsify water and olive oil, two substances that can't mix, to create the perfect sauce that clings to the pasta in the most perfect way. It's like being an Italian chef. \n\n──I see. \n\nRevo: I think the reason that everything seems so seamless is probably because I sense the core of the series from the onset. Even looking back with the knowledge I have now, I can think \"Yeah, it's on the right track.\" When I was creating \"Guren no Yumiya\" and \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa,\" Paradis Island, surrounded by walls, was my entire world. I was running forward without knowing what the future of that world would look like. But, even after everything unfolded in the story, I can still feel that my songs have a solid core and message.\n\n──Speaking of \"Guren no Yumiya,\" the version included in this best album has new narration by Armin (Voiced by marina Inoue), originally performed at the \"Attack on Titan 10th ANNIVERSARY 'ATTACK FES' DAY1\" event at K Arena Yokohama this January. It reflects on the emotions of Armin and the other members of the Survey Corps as they prepare to face Eren in the climax of the story.\n\nRevo: It feels like something strange is happening to the timeline, right? This may have been something that I shouldn't have done, but when I looked at the series overall, I though that this kind of direction was fitting. 'Attack on Titan' is a series where various memories connect through \"Paths.\" Because this story began with \"Guren no Yumiya,\" I felt it was necessary to deliver a current message to listeners who've followed 'Attack on Titan' until the very end. The version included in 'Shingeki no Kiseki,' (which added the narration \"Fly over the walls towards the sea!\") was no longer appropriate. After the final battle and after losing so much, I wanted to convey something that still remains, something like a soul, still burning. The original author, Hajime Isayama-Sensei, added lines to the final episode of the anime that weren't in the manga. Perhaps I was inspired by his passion to keep delivering something until the very end when I went to add those lines. It's that kind of sincerity as a creator, struggling to convey something until it's finally finished. Something on the other side of that struggle resonates with people's souls.\n\n\n──I see, so this version of \"Guren no Yumiya\" was like your answer to Isayama-Sensei. Listening to this new narration, I was deeply moved, realizing that the arrow continued to fly until the very end. \n\nRevo: In the Spotify video podcast (aired last November, where the interviewer was the host) after the broadcast of 'Attack on Titan' The Final Chapters Part 2,' you mentioned that \"the arrow kept flying until the very end.\" Maybe those words you said stuck with me. It made me feel like \"the dream I had that day is still flying.\"\n\n──No no, that's far too much credit... the phrase \"the arrow kept flying\" is something you've said in the past, Revo-san. You've expressed such in the theme songs you've written, like \"Shinzou wo Sasageyo\" and \"Shoukei to Shikabane no Michi,\" which incorporate the melody of \"Guren no Yumiya.\" That melody is what you've described as \"the arrow kept flying.\"\n\nRevo: I felt like those words resonated with many \"Attack on Titan\" fans. the title logo of the best album also features an arrow, but it wasn't there at first. Because I wanted to use the symbolic motif that \"the arrow continued to fly until the very end,\" I asked the team \"please add an arrow.\" By making that clear in the final work, I feel that it became a symbolic message throughout the entire album. \n\n──Also, there's a new song entitled \"Watashi ga Hontou ni Hoshikatta Mono\" only in the Special Edition of the album. It's a song that only a very limited number of people will be able to hear, but... it was still very moving to realize that her song was still there. \n\nRevo: I can't create songs for every character, but when I really realized it was the end and realized I had the chance to make just one more song, I thought everyone would be satisfied if it was her song. However, this is really just a \"story-inspired image song\" that I created from my imagination. She's a character when one asks \"can she even talk?\" Being able to have such a character sing and narrate in a way that accesses their heart is part of the richness of Story Music. This is the latest piece in the 20 years of Story Music I've undertaken. I've packed a lot of information into such a short duration, while leaving space for listeners to think. Since the original author supervised and gave it the OK, I don't think it was an impossible interpretation to arrive at (laughs). \n\n──The 16 songs in the Regular Edition alone are definitely moving on their own, but listening to \"Watashi ga Hontou ni Hoshikatta Mono\" at the end really makes you feel that this song is both \"the end\" and \"a beginning.\" Now that your Link with 'Attack on Titan' has come to a close, do you feel any sadness?\n\nRevo: Of course, but I have to move on to the next thing. \n\nI didn't say \"Please draw Revo\"\n──I'd also like to ask you about the album cover. For the first press of the Regular Edition, the cover was drawn by Isayama-Sensei. Surprisingly, you, Revo-san, appear on it!\n\nRevo: There's something I want to make very clear about this cover. I didn't say \"Please draw Revo!\" (laughs). Of course, I did ask \"Could Isayama-san please draw the cover?\" but I never asked him to draw me. I left the content of the cover entirely up to him, and when I received it... surprise! There I was. \n\n──Is that so? What did you think when you first received it?\n\nRevo: I guess I'd say... I was so beyond impressed I just started laughing. Have you ever had that happen? When you're so surprised that you just can't help but laugh?\n\n──Yes I have! (laughs)\n\nRevo: It wasn't like tears or anything like that. It was more like bursting out in laughter (laughs). I was laughing while saying \"So this is what you came up with?!\" Plus, the cover is stylized just like the covers of the 'Attack on Titan' manga. It would be no exaggeration to call it the final, unreleased volume. Well, no, that's a complete exaggeration (laughs). But still, the sentiment behind it made me really happy. \n\n──It seems that to Isayama-Sensei, this is how you, Revo-san, appear after all these years working on 'Attack on Titan.'\n\nRevo: It would make me very happy if he felt as if we were \"fighting together\" or \"walking this path together.\" Of course, the anime played a huge role, but if my music became even a small part of Isayama-San's creative energy, it's truly an honor. As a fan of 'Attack on Titan,' this illustration really warms my heart.\n\n──Looking back, the global impact of the collaboration between 'Attack on Titan' and Linked Horizon is truly immeasurable. \n\nRevo: I think the true impact of it may only be realized much later. The global reception of Japanese music is completely different now than it was ten years ago. It really feels like \"the world has changed\" without us even noticing. It's as if \"the distance between Japan and the rest of the world has shrunk.\" With rapid technological advancements in IT, which we find ourselves in the middle of, we're receiving an overwhelming response from all over the world.  However, I'm sure both good and bad aspects will emerge from this looking back. As cultural exchanges accelerate, there will inevitably be friction. If we live in a world where unimaginable praise exists, we must also be prepared for unimaginable criticism. Both sides of the coin always accompany us in these changing times, and I'm sure that the real \"next era\" is waiting for us in the future. \n\n──So, you're saying that we haven't really reached the \"next era\" yet?\n\nRevo: That's right. I think we're still in a transitional period. We need to deepen mutual understanding much more. It's just just about exporting (culture), but also attitudes about importing should be questioned. I don't think it's easy to escape cultural and racial bias, but we live in an age where if you put your heart and soul into something and work hard at it, it's possible for it to reach someone in the world in a remote, distance place. The barriers that existed a long time ago no longer exist. the \"next era\" may be created by the generation that has grown up seeing both the successes and failures of such creations reaching the world. \n\n──So, for example, the fact that \"Shinzou so Sasageyo!\" is sung all over the world is an example of a successful thing that has \"reached\" people, right?\n\nRevo: I saw a video where someone was playing that song on a street piano in a foreign country, and a passerby stopped to dedicate their hearts, striking the iconic pose. Not everyone knows it, but those who know it \"share\" something in humanity that goes beyond the community they'd originally grow up belonging to. Conceptually, it could be seen as a new-age anthem. People who love the same things could have the same home there. I'm not talking in geographic terms, but of spiritual ones. It's a concept that we sing in Sound Horizon's National Anthem (\"Eikou no Idou Oukoku -The Glory Kingdom-\"). I know we've talked about the \"next era\" and other big things, but it doesn't mean that each one of us is personally removed from it. There's no need to get too worked up about it, but it's a given that I'll just continue to make good music (laughs). I have to do my best!",

What is the world view like this time?\nYokoyan: One of the ways to enjoy Sound Horizon is to explore the world yourself by listening to the CD, so I'll keep it a secret. I cannot give out any clues that you can't already find for yourself in the illustrations. \n\nQ4: Is there a concept or a specific direction that guided this work?\nYokoyan: There is, but it's hard to express. I believe you can find it in the lyrics.\n\n Q5: Many things are hidden throughout one single album illustration. Where did you get ideas like this from?\nYokoyan: That idea came from the album's various stories being interconnected. \n\nQ6: How do you and Revo-shi communicate during production?\nYokoyan: We live far away from each other, so we mainly talk over the phone. We exchange data over email. Sometimes we chat a bit in the dressing room before a concert. \n\nQ7: What materials do you use to create your illustrations?\nYokoyan: Mainly a computer and a pen tablet, using Photoshop software.\n\nQ8: How do you start drawing your illustrations? Do you start by sketching out your plans or do you just start drawing immediately?\nYokoyan: I do both. I don't have a fixed method. \n\nQ9: Do you listen to the music you're illustrating for while working on your artwork?\nYokoyan: I often listen to the unfinished tracks that are sent to me. Besides that, I don't usually make it a habit to listen to music while I work. \n\nQ10: Could you tell us about any influences in your art, be they music, novels, or people?\nYokoyan: My parents. \n\nQ11: If you have any behind-the-scenes stories from this album's production, please share them.\nYokoyan: I don't have any. \n\nQ12: Please say a few words to the fans and to those who want to start drawing.\nYokoyan: There may be people out there quietly supporting me, so I want to quietly continue to do my best. I also want to quietly support those who would want to start drawing. \n\nMessage from Revo\n\nApproximately a year and a half has passed since I released my last work, and many things have happened in that time. It is after accepting and moving forward with all of those experiences that we have reached this horizon. I have firmly focused on the creative motive and starting point of \"expressing stories through music,\" and even as the scale of the story gets grander and grander, I continue to pay careful attention to the details of the scenery expressed.\n\nI am confident that this has become a work that can be considered a culmination of our efforts at this point.\nWhat is connected and what is not?\nWho is lying?\nOr is no one lying?\nThe endlessly rotating morning and night, the repeated cycle of life and death.\nOscillating between reality and fiction; The Fifth Horizon.\nIs there a Roman to be found there?\n\nHow you interpret this story is up to you.\nSalut!

      "content": "~\n\nFrom the Desk of the Ruling Head Regarding \"The Freedom of Interpretation\" Revo Apr. 2024 Letter\nPublication date: 04.24.2024\n\n\nTN: On April 24th, 2024 Revo released this statement in response to the 9th anniversary of 'Nein' as various voice actors, singers, and artists involved in the album posted memories and congratulations to various social media. Mari Yura, the vocalist who portrayed the character DINg, posted a tweet that contained lyrics that were sung but not featured in the lyric booklet. Revo, who believes in the power of an individual's interpretation, replied with the following letter:\n\nCiao everyone!\nIt seems that there was some discussion on social media recently celebrating the 9th anniversary of 'Nein,' particularly in regard to how to read the lyrics in 《》 by parties involved in the work.\nI received a report from the royal guardsman that said \"We have heard that this is causing quite a stir among Laurants and others online,\" and I was quite surprised.\nWhy would something like this happen now?\nIs it precisely because it's happening now?\n\nThe statement in question has been requested to be retracted, but I do not think it's as simple as just retracting it.\nTo avoid unnecessary confusion among you all, and to ensure that those involved adhere to their duty of confidentiality, I believe it is necessary for the head chairman to express his views in his own words.  \n\nI thought so, at least...\nHowever, due to various circumstances, things are moving slowly and I apologize for that truly. \n\nFirst of all, let me explain a bit more for those thinking \"What's this all about?\"\n\nIn the lyrics of SH, the lyrics enclosed in《》are often not pronounced as written. It became like this somehow over the years, and I don't intend to discuss its origins or the value in this practice, so just accept it as it is. \n\nWhat is actually pronounced is called a Rubi, and the issue is that these Rubi are not listed on the official lyric cards. In other words, if you see Rubi somewhere, it's not official information. \n\nSo, in short, it's misinformation. But I deliberately don't call it a \"lie.\" This is because I believe there is no intention or malice to deceive people by sharing their interpretation of Rubi. It's because \"someone misheard.\"\n\nThat \"mishearing\" is one of the precious elements of \"The Freedom of Interpretation.\"\nand it's okay for it to sound different depending on the person.\n\nThey range from simple to understand to ones that have barriers of entry;\nfrom things that wouldn't occur to you without prior knowledge or education, to even those with double or triple meanings.\nRegardless, I believe it is the listener's freedom to interpret them. \n\nAnd thus, we treasure this freedom. \n\nSome may think 'If it's so free, then don't the lyrics just fall apart?' I also believe that it's okay to have a degree of uncertainty. That's because the essential information is clearly found in the lyric booklet, within 《》.\n\nTherefore, no matter how you choose to read the Rubi, the flow of the lyrics should remain intact.\n'Well, what's the definition of lyrics then?'\n'Am I the only one who doesn't get it?'\nI think these simple questions may arise, but to that I'd say\n\"Don't worry, I don't get it either!\"\n\nHmm,\nHowever, there's also an interesting aspect to what we don't understand, and I feel that's where the essence of art is found. The more the notation and pronunciation diverge, the more the definition of the lyrics might break down.\nHowever, there is individuality in where the line is set,\nIt seems to me that this is a battleground where entertainment and art are at war with each other.\nIt's similar to the debate in comedy over 'Where does the skit end and stand-up begin?'\n\nBack to the lyrics. I think I'm doing something akin to taboo. Or, maybe I've already crossed the line. If this world had stricter rules, I may be put in prison. It's a relief that we don't live in a world where the 'Rubi Police' wield immense control...\n\nAh, let's get back on track. Laurants, be proud of your mishearing. If you're at karaoke, sing boldly. Sing your mishearing loud. \n\nYou may think 'It would be embarrassing if I'm wrong though' But who determines what's right or wrong? For something that doesn't officially exist, there's no right answer. Even those who declare 'That's wrong!' might be mistaken themselves. \n\nI'll say it again. Laurants, be proud of your mishearing. Even if there's no Rubi, or only pictures instead of dialogue, it's all good. Sing out loud. Sing your mishearing. Your Story. Your horizon.\n\nI apologize for the length, but for the reasons I've stated above, I believe there should not be an official brandishing of a 'correct answer,' and I am wary of guiding people towards creating a 'definitive correct answer' merely from 'comments from parties involved in production.'\n\nTo put this bluntly, even parties involved in production can spread misinformation. And there's no one who can take responsibility for that. I neither endorse nor deny its content. It's simply not official information. \n\n\"The Freedom of Interpretation by the Listener.\"\n\nIn the nation of SHK, this is a right extended to citizens that should be highly respected. Please refrain from actions that could infringe on this right. I would like to once again request this for all parties involved in production.\n\nThe Freedom of Interpretation.\nI've been making music that encapsulates such a vague expression for about 20 years now. It doesn't exist without those who can interpret. Even before the name Laurant was born, I've always thought of it as a culture I've nurtured with you all. \n\nSome of you may be thinking 'this is way too much of a hassle!' after reading this far. It's completely fine if you just listen to my music without overthinking it, don't worry. \n\nStill, I believe there are some who feel that this murky swamp water doesn't suit them. For these people, it's okay to move to a different swamp. After all, this isn't the only swamp of music or, maybe, there isn't even a swamp for music at all. \n\nHowever, I'm aware that there are many who are fully submerged in this swamp up to their shoulders. Once you get used to it, it's a comfortable place to live, isn't it? Not just 'Nein,' but all of the works and all of the various interpretations that arise from them.\nThank you for loving them. \n\nWell, due to various circumstances and the best album and on and on, I'll return to my duties. \n\nSee you!"
